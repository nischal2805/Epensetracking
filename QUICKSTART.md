## Database Features to Test

### Supabase (SQL)
- User profile creation
- Group creation and member management
- Expense CRUD operations
- Balance calculations with user_balances view
- Row Level Security (try accessing other users' data - it should fail!)

### Firebase (NoSQL)
- Activity logs (check Firebase Console â†’ Firestore â†’ activityLogs)
- Receipt storage (check Firebase Console â†’ Storage â†’ receipts)
- NLP cache (check Firestore â†’ nlpCache)

## Common Issues

### "Cannot connect to Supabase"
- Verify VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are correct
- Check internet connection
- Supabase project should be active

### "Firebase is not configured"
- Update Firebase credentials in .env
- See FIREBASE_SETUP.md for detailed setup
- For testing, demo credentials work but won't persist data

### "NLP parsing gives wrong results"
- NLP parser uses pattern matching, not AI
- Try examples from the UI
- Supported patterns:
  - "I paid X for Y"
  - "Spent X on Y"
  - "Paid â‚¹X for Y"

### "Receipt upload fails"
- Firebase Storage must be configured
- Check FIREBASE_SETUP.md for security rules
- OCR is simulated (2-second delay, random data)

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint

# Production build
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Next Steps

1. **Add More Members**: In group settings, add members by email
2. **Test Split Types**: Try custom splits with different amounts
3. **Explore Categories**: Add expenses in different categories
4. **Check Balances**: See automatic debt simplification
5. **View Activity**: Monitor all actions in Activity feed

## Mobile Gestures

- **Pull to refresh**: On Groups list
- **Swipe to delete**: (Coming soon) On expense items
- **Long press**: (Coming soon) On group for options

## Pro Tips

### Indian Rupee Formatting
- Enter amounts like: `1000`, `1500.50`
- Display shows: `â‚¹1,000.00`, `â‚¹1,500.50`
- Large amounts use lakhs/crores notation

### NLP Examples That Work Well
- "I paid 500 for lunch"
- "Spent 1200 on movie yesterday"
- "Paid â‚¹350 for cab"
- "Split 2000 for grocery"

### Categories Auto-Detection
- "dinner", "lunch" â†’ Food
- "movie", "concert" â†’ Entertainment
- "taxi", "uber" â†’ Travel
- "grocery", "shopping" â†’ Shopping
- "rent", "electricity" â†’ Bills
